# Heart-Disease-Prediction

The goal of researching the association between these characteristics
and heart disease is to get a better knowledge of the potential risk
poses by this feature on heart disease and to build reliable models for
predicting heart disease.There were a few difficulties with this
analysis, including:
1. Getting a big, diverse dataset for analysis that
appropriately represents the community of interest is one of the biggest
obstacles. 
2. The quality of the data gathered is a significant
difficulty; in our instance, the study of the cholestrol variable,
inaccurate data might have a substantial impact on the findings. 
3. Another issue in this research is selecting the most relevant factors,
as the number of variables might be fairly vast, and not all variables
may be useful for the categorization of heart disease. 
4. I've simply used the logistics regression model in my example, but choosing the best
model for this study is difficult because it can have a big impact on
the outcomes. 
5. Finally, applying domain knowledge from the medical
field to the outcomes.

Few Mistake that were made during the analysis, was not properly dealing
with the outlier before deploying the model like applying dimensionality
reduction theorem on the outliers or any other technique. If I had more
time to complete the research, I would have conducted a more thorough
analysis of each variable's distribution, as well as a deeper
investigation into the association between each variable and heart
disease using a random forest model and other sophisticated statistical
techniques.

Another research subject I'd want to look at is: 
1. To determine the relationship between different variables and the likelihood of heart disease. 
2. Using a machine learning technique, to discover the most important predictors of heart disease. 
3. Investigate the effect of demographic parameters on the risk of heart disease, such as age and gender. 
4. Using predictive modelling tools, uncover possible early warning indicators for heart disease.

The same research question(s) could have been addressed differently if
data contain 
1. The smoking habbits of the patients. 
2. Also, contains the variables like patients were on any medication or had any other disease 
3. Data would give more insight if it contains the occupation and more demographic data. 
4. data on Eating habbits could also be usefull. 
5. Data about if they drink alchol or not.
